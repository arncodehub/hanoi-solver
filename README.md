**Towers of Hanoi**

*This project is a Tower of Hanoi solver, not one that allows you to play the game yourself!*

The solver can solve *any* Tower of Hanoi game, from the initial starting position.

It needs to have *N* disks, from one to ten.

*Reason: Less than one is not possible. Above ten, would take many thousands of steps.*

There is no visualization of the program solving the tower.
It just prints the sequence of transfers required to do so.

Example for 3 disks:
*Move A to C!*
*Move A to B!*
*Move C to B!*
*Move A to C!*
*Move B to A!*
*Move B to C!*
*Move A to C!*

Have fun, trying this demo out!

*This clearly is not a completed project!*
